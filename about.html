            <h1>Who Are We?</h1>
            <p>
                We are <strong>Muhammed Fatih Asan</strong> and <strong>Talha Ubeydullah Gamga</strong>, 
                Computer Engineering students at <strong>Ankara YÄ±ldÄ±rÄ±m BeyazÄ±t University</strong>.  
                Passionate about web technologies, we chose the <strong>Responsive Web Design</strong> elective course 
                to strengthen our understanding and refine our hands-on skills.  
    
                As part of our coursework, we embarked on an exciting project: developing an educational coding platform 
                that makes learning programming easier and more interactive through engaging exercises and fun coding games.  
                <br>

            <h1>Why Are We Developing This Project?</h1>
            <p>
                Our mission is simple: make coding fun, accessible, and beginner-friendly!  
                We believe that programming shouldnâ€™t be intimidating, it should be an enjoyable and interactive experience.  
            </p>
            <p>
                Our platform is designed to help beginners take their first steps in coding through two main sections:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>ðŸ“– <strong>Prep Zone</strong> â€“ Explore coding concepts in beginner-friendly languages.</li>
                <li>ðŸŽ® <strong>Challenge Arena</strong> â€“ Reinforce knowledge through hands-on coding challenges and engaging interactive games.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                By blending education with entertainment, we aim to inspire and empower newcomers to dive into the world of coding with confidence and excitement!
